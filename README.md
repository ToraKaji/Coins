<p>Coins is a fun penny popping game in which users try to match "coin values" in a row, column, or diagonal. If said user does match them they will recieve that many coins into there balance. Each play costs 18 of their available coins if they lose, if they win however, the amount that they align will be added to their balance.</p>
